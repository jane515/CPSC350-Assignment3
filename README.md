Assignment 3

The GenStack.h file is a template class for generic stack. It contains all functions need in a stack. The Syntaxchecker.cpp file is a file that checks if the delimiters are all closed. The main file will first read a file from the user and store all the opening delimiter symbols ('(' ,'[' ,'{' )in a stack. Once the there is a closing delimiter symbol (')',']','}'), it will pop the opening delimiter symbol from the stack. If the two does not match. The system will tell the user which line does the closing delimiter symbol is located.
